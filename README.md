# Calculator
## This is the final project in The Odin Project's project. The idea is theirs, design is based on window calculator. But the creation is mine.

### How to use:
- The input consist of two numbers and one operator in the middle. (e.g., 6+9)
- Press the "=" button
- The result is displaying on the screen
